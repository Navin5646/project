I am personally very sensitive towards this issue because I have seen a road accident death near my hometown Alwar, Rajasthan when I was just 10 years Old. It left a huge impact on me. And since then I myself became very particular about traffic rules and road safety. But I never got a chance to work directly at the grass level of this issue which I always wanted to. I believe being the largest youth led organisation working towards making the Indian roads safer IRSC will give me a huge opportunity to work directly for such a major and much ignored issue of road safety. Also my interest in roads and highways have gradually increased after attending a talk by Mr. Rohit Kumar Singh , Member (Finance) NHAI. He spoke about the public private partnership of NHAI and its working but along with that he majorly spoke about the road safety of Highways in India and that inspired me a lot.

Because firstly, I  am very concerned and passionate about the issue of road safety.

Also I am in a great support of its mission 2020 of reducing the death toll of road acccidents across India to half by 2020. I believe that being a researcher I can contribute towards it to a great extent. Secondly, I have an experience in research work at college level. Since I am a part of LSR\'s Economics Department\'s research society called Mentored research forum under which I along with my team wrote a research paper on Income inequality in India. Also I have written two research paper as a part of my course namely Censorship and Nationalism in India and Emergency in India: 1971-75.

I had read many research papers, scientific journals and articles regarding the hybrid vehicle system and thus have gained a fair share of knowledge. I have developed a knack for doing the research work in this process, which is thus required for technical writing.\r\nTherefore, it will be my pleasure to do the research work for the given study material on road safety and figure out strategies to reduce road accidents and fatalities. IRSC having ties with some of the highest authorities of our nation as well with other global organizations, would give me a valuable opportunity to work along their sides.

For this I was given a certificate for creativity as well. I have also participated in a lot of activities like elocution, extempore, discussions and quiz contests, once representing my school in quiz at state level.\r\nI experienced a major setback after class 12th when I failed to compete in medical entrance.

A major fraction of these accidents turned up in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, but small cities also witnessed quite a large number of accidents during the period. One of the reasons for such a wicked figure of accidents is that India at present is having a car boom. India is witnessing tremendous growth in automobile sector this seems true to a certain extent, when we look at facts such as, in Delhi alone, almost 10,000 new cars hit the road every month. However, the main reason for large number of accidents is due to negligence and lack of sense of responsibility from the drivers\' part.\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at the causes of road accidents in India:\r\n\r\n1. Speeding and overtaking.\r\n2. Talking on Phone while driving .\r\n3. Do not drink and drive.\r\n4. Riding Without a Helmet .\r\n5. Not Wearing Seat Belt.\r\n6. Breaking Traffic Rules.\r\n7. Poor Road Infrastructure .\r\n\r\nWe can tackel such situations by taking care of followings-\r\n\r\n1.Better  roads, no stop lights or stop signs at the end of a downhill blind corner.\r\n2.Better signage, no fine print, full words, Caps and smalls, proper contrast and reflectivity, arrows actually pointing in meaningful directions.\r\n3.Fewer words per minute per mile, no more words per sign than can be comprehended by a 4th grade reading level in one reading in the time available at the legal speed,\r\n4.Fewer decisions per minute per mile, reduce the number of decisions per second that drivers must make, such as too many overlapping entrances and exits and signs in a series of intersections that are too close to each other,\r\n5.No left exits or entrances, the left lane is for high speed and passing, not for slowing down to exit, or starting slow to catch up to traffic, those cause slow cars to dangerously mix with fast cars,\r\n6.All roads one-way, no oncoming traffic, yes, considerable redesigns needed, but easier for new roadways,\r\n7.No parallel parking, which block the traffic lanes for extended periods of time while the unskilled drivers argue with the laws of vector physics,\r\n8.Equalize traffic vehicles 1, no sharing of roadways with pedestrians or self-powered devices such as bicycles,\r\n9.Equalize traffic vehicles 2, separate truck and motorcycle lanes?\r\n10.Clasify vehicles by shape, size, weight, subject SUVs to truck rules, no SUVs in the left lane, get a car that does not obstruct vision and tear up the roadway due to excessive weight, has anyone seen an SUV with people actually in every seat, like a bus? ( or has anyone actually seen an SUV off the road, in the woods, climbing a mountain, crossing a desert, for any reason, at any time ? I digress â€¦ ),\r\n11.No intersections, in the early days of the automobile, the only two cars in Ohio collided with each other at an intersection because they had no protocol for right-of-way, and yet, today, with lifetimes of right-of-way protocols, people are still colliding with each other,\r\n12.Automatic C2C car to car radar interactions to empower vehicles to intelligently brake or swerve to avoid each other,\r\n13.Free tire-air-pressure pumps at roadway entrances, to ensure the most stable and predictable vehicle control, taxes on roads and vehicles and fuel should pay for such simple yet critical things,\r\n14.Free car-wash drive-through at roadway entrances, to clear dirty glass and covered lights and muddy license plates, again, taxes on roads and vehicles and fuel should pay for such simple yet critical things,\r\n15.Free and SAFE sleep-parking, actively monitored â€œsleepâ€ parking at entrances to roadways, and periodically along the way, again, taxes on roads and vehicles and fuel should pay for such simple yet critical things,\r\n16.No always-on police speed radar, police putting down their radar guns and actually watching and participating in traffic to identify unsafe conditions, situations, and behaviors, including bad roadway design, bad signage, potholes,\r\n17.Newer safer vehicles, cash incentives to trade older less safe vehicles that have no full-curtain air bags, ABS ESP anti-lock braking systems with electronic stability programs, back-up cameras, and so on, for newer safer vehicles so equipped, including INCREASING registration fees as a vehicle ages and or is found to not contain modern safety features and benefits,\r\n18.Flexible speed limits that are dynamically related to weather and traffic load, yes, higher speed limits, sometimes,\r\n19.Auto-paid pre-paid tolls automatically paid by OCR optical character recognition of our vehicleâ€™s license plate, to prevent stops and swerving on highways while fishing for coins and paper money,\r\n20.Heads-up-display of vehicle information and travel information,\r\n21.Clear forward view, better vehicle design with center mirror ABOVE the line of sight and side mirrors BELOW the line of sight, so the driver has a clear unobstructed panoramic view forward,\r\n22.Clear rear view, better mirrors and cameras and displays so the driver has an unobstructed panoramic view to the sides and behind,\r\n23.Intelligent window filters, see-through polarized visor filters to eliminate low-sun blinding,\r\n24.Intelligently cross-polarized lights and glass and mirrors to eliminate blinding glare,\r\n25.Recessed roadside obstructions, buildings and trees recessed from the roadway so as not to cast shadows on the road, reducing patches of ice that would otherwise be melted by sunshine like the rest of the roadway, and to reduce visual incongruities where our driving path is in full daylight, and then suddenly in deep shadow,\r\n26.Eliminate roadside obstructions, no poles or trees or buildings at the immediate roadside, they are impenetrably deadly in a collision,\r\n27.Visual, physical, and acoustic lane markers, well maintained visual and â€œsoundâ€ lane markers, buzz-noise-making â€œteethâ€ cut into the roadway between lanes,\r\n28.Driver-aligned traffic lights, traffic controls in the line-of-sight when stopped at a stop line, not above the vehicle, and not off to the side, and not -w-a-y- down the road beyond any relationship to the stop line,\r\n29.Timed red/yellow/green lights, traffic control lights that are consistently timed between colors, donâ€™t go from constant green â€¦ to amber-then-immediately-red, but adding steps with two lights on together in sequence, such as\r\na.green alone,\r\nb.then amber+green ( â€¦ 2 â€¦ 3 â€¦ ),\r\nc.then amber alone ( â€¦ 2 â€¦ 3 â€¦ ),\r\nd.then red+amber ( â€¦ 2â€¦ 3 â€¦),\r\ne.then red alone,\r\nf.â€¦ where the in between timing lets the driver know the actual count to red for THIS traffic control, the flow of the sequence may be faster in cities with 25 mile per hour speed limits, or slower on full-speed highways, but each traffic control light can be observed and predicted because the sequence is always the same, and the first 2 steps accurately predict the second two steps for each traffic control light countdown.\r\n30.Horn-fired missiles, car-mounted paint ball guns with dashboard-triggers to mark unsafe driverâ€™s cars so their cars eventually are so dotted and speckled that they are screaming â€œâ€¦ take me off the road â€¦â€ and â€œâ€¦ watch out â€¦â€ and â€œâ€¦ watch me with heightened scrutiny, dear police â€¦â€,\r\n31.Cameras everywhere, including dash-cams, all broadcasting live to the web, including government cams, including police dash-cams and body-cams, with audio, â€œâ€¦ see that jerk cutting everyone off?!? â€¦ and see their license plate number? â€¦â€,\r\n32.Breathalyzer interlocks, perhaps attention-test interlocks, how about winning a grand-theft-auto video game on a heads-up display before the vehicle will start, or watching contemporaneous videos of deadly accidents before the vehicle will start, the number and length of the videos based on the g-forces and brake pressures recorded in prior driving sessions by that driver, I know I drive with loads of safety space around me immediately after watching YouTube crash videos,\r\n33.Night lighting, especially around busy interaction points,\r\n34.Eliminate non-traffic signage, such as advertisements, billboards, anything visible from the road should be roadway information only, sorry, businesses, but you want your customers to actually arrive alive, right?\r\n35.High-integrity road surfaces, road surfaces that are well-maintained, pothole-free, wave-free, level and smooth, yet high-friction, that siphon off water and oil, and do not raise blinding fine-mist in the rain,\r\n36.Appropriately radiused and banked corners,\r\n37.Soft crash barriers, soft landing provision for vehicles leaving the roadway, such as earthen ravines and berms, plastic tanks of water, not stone and concrete walls,\r\n38.Jersey-walls beside the flow of traffic instead of any other barrier, Jersey-walls lift an errant vehicle to eliminate itâ€™s errant trajectory energy, and direct the vehicle back into the flow of traffic with minimum damage, I know, Iâ€™ve been saved by Jersey-walls â€¦ only to see them replaced by â€œprettyâ€ stone walls that are deadly for everyone in the vicinity of a collision.', 'It will help me to make better decisions to analyze complex situations.

They just don\'t consider the fact that even other people are travelling on the roads or not.

The nation is performing extremely well in fields such as education, industrialization and fashion. However the conditions of the roads, be it the metropolitans, towns or villages, act as a major pothole in Indiaâ€™s complete progress. According to the Road Accident Report for 2014 prepared by the road transport and highways ministry, 75,000 people have been killed because of the killer roads of India.\r\nSpeeding: Another major factor contributing to the increased number of road accidents is speeding. The public fails to follow the speed limits, especially on the highway. This has resulted in 41% of the total deaths due to road accidents in India in 2014.\r\nOverloaded vehicles: Be it passengers or goods, overloaded vehicles are also a major cause for accidents in India. It becomes difficult to control an overloaded vehicle. When a vehicle is carrying goods such as protruding steel rods, the result of an accident is even worse. Overloaded vehicles have accounted for 36,543 deaths in 2014.\r\nDrunken driving: Even though driving under the influence of alcohol is strictly prohibited, many flaunt this rule, which at times results in road accidents. Even if the person under the influence of alcohol walks away safe from the scene of the accident due to the safety features of the car, the pedestrians and smaller vehicles involved in the accidents are not so lucky.\r\nHelmets: Two-wheelers account for 30% of the road accidents in India. Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of severe injury by 72% and the risk of death by 39%, according to the World Health Organisation. But only a handful of the cities in India have made the use of helmets mandatory.\r\nSafer road for vehicles, not people: While India has been upgrading its highways since 2000, with dividers, four-lane and six-lane roads and expressways, the design does not cater to the requirements of pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheelers, animal carts and other slow-moving traffic.\r\nAmong the countries that have been most successful in reducing the number of crashes, the main factors seem to include:\r\nA political commitment, across all ministries concerned, to deal with road accidents.\r\nA broad strategy, involving education, engineering and enforcement to deal with accidents.\r\nA clear vision and numerical targets for reductions in the different categories of accidents.\r\nA concrete plan with specific measures for implementation and enforcement.\r\nInstitutional co-ordination within and between different levels of government and with private actors.\r\nCareful and critical evaluation of measures and their effectiveness.\r\n      It is obvious that above-mentioned initiatives have not been taken in India.

All these are caused due to faults at every level including driver,builders and authorities. Most of the accidents in India occur in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai due to the recent boom in vehicle purchases.A key factor in almost all accidents is over speeding. A simple and practical approach to tackle this problem is by using modern day Camera and Sensor Technology.Cameras equipped with speed sensors can be attached to street lights at set distances. These cameras can be positioned at a specific angle to click a picture of the number plate of the over speeding vehicle. Using a simple Image processing program the number of vehicle can be extracted from the image of number plate. This data will then be sent to a central server. Officials there can use this information to fine and prosecute the offender and even alert the local police if they find it necessary.Cyber securities measures should be used to prevent the tampering of this data which will help reduce bribery of officials and also ensure stricter enforcement of the law.The offender can also be notified by an Email/SMS  instantly. The camera system can use solar cells which helps remove their dependence on electricity supply. This system can also be used to tackle other issues like red light jumping and can also be used for automatic toll collection, all with small modifications. Since this technology is currently used by military to some extent,it will be easier to implement since less Research and development will be required and mass production can be carried out economically.

The condition of roads in a region, the traffic density on them and their aesthetics are often the first parameters and foremost aspects people use to judge the quality of infrastructure and liveability of a region.  \r\n\r\nWhy are accidents a commonly occurring phenomenon on Indian roads? First and foremost it is due to the fact that most road designs do not view roads as a multidimensional and multilayered space. Roads are purely designed and constructed keeping in mind motorised vehicular movement without any regard to people, pedestrians, non-motorised and alternative modes or transport, utility and amenities, and economic activities. A lack of demarcated space for all these aspects leads to large conflict points on our streets, where one cramped space is being shared by fast moving vehicles, slow moving vehicles, pedestrians, hawkers, utility cables and various other amenities. It is for this reason mayhem and accidents are common on our roads.  \r\n\r\nAnd then there are all the other common factors, like lack of signages, and markings as per IRC and MoRTH guidelines, poor enforcement of the law and poor conditions of the roads themselves. \r\n\r\nTo reduce the number of accidents on your streets it if important to remove the number of conflict points and design roads for various aspects. Designing a road should be done with a collaborative approach keeping in view the effect it has on all stakeholders. It is first imperative  to understand that roads act as not just a medium for transportation and commute from point A to B, but also equally act as a medium for carrying other amenities such as storm water drains, sewage systems, fiberoptic cables, electricity lines and a whole host of other amenities. It is also imperative to view roads as a multidimensional  space and to understand the need to design roads as a viable space for economic activities as well as all types of travel (vehicular / motorised / non-motorised). A well designed and efficiently functional road would have separate and distinct demarcations for all of these various aspects and activities listed above therefore resulting in a reduction in the number of conflict zones and effectively reducing the number of accidents. \r\n\r\nApart from this,  better law enforcement using technology, proper road signage and markings, a clear and continuous right of way without any undulations, separate parking bays, separate bus bays, pick-up and drop-off lanes, separate turning lanes for right / left turns, demarcated cycle tracks and walkways should all be provided for arterial and collector roads to ensure that the main travel lanes are always kept clear of encroachments and nothing abruptly blocks the path of a moving vehicle.  \r\n\r\nAll these factors combined will form an effective method to reduce accidents and conflicts on your roads. \r\n\r\n\r\n', 'I would like to study on ground, in-depth a problem zone within my city and conceptualise a workable plan to help tackle the problem source, thereby creating a new normal on ground.\r\n\r\nI would be able to spare 6 months of uninterrupted time for this internship.

Do not drink and driveâ€“ Fire and ice can still go together, but drinking and driving can never be mixed. Alcohol interferes with the very basic elements of driving such as vision, reflex, and sense of justice. So donâ€™t drink and drive.\r\n\r\n4. Riding Without a Helmet â€“ Many youngsters think driving without a helmet is a cool and swag thing. But the fact is a biker looks cooler when he is all geared up with safety kneecaps, rider\'s jacket, and a sturdy helmet. Wearing a helmet is as important for the pillion rider as for the biker. Head is most susceptible to injuries during a fall. Protecting it with a helmet substantially reduces the chances of injury during an accident.\r\n\r\n5. Not Wearing Seat Belt â€“ Putting a seat belt while driving is as important as same as pulling a parachute while skydiving. It has been scientifically proven that during a head collision, a driver wearing a seat belt has a far better chance to survive.\r\n\r\n6. Breaking Traffic Rules â€“ Something as simple as breaking a red light can put the driver and others vulnerable to serious falls and injuries. Ignorance of road signs can prove to be a breakneck too. Do follow traffic rules; it\'s for your own good.\r\n\r\n7. Poor Road Infrastructure â€“ This is a very common cause of accidents in India. Unlike other factors, the driver here has to suffer without a fault of his own. A bad road is stated by signs such as piles of debris, spilled oil, pits and defective highway lamps.RAM\r\n\r\nNOW SOME IDEAS TO DESIGN A PROGRAM TO TACKLE IT ...\r\nFIRST IS  use innovative crosswalks these are saving pedestrian\'s lives.\r\nSecond is we use dynamic program approach to save road accidents in India by defining the stages as first is the seasonal ratio of accidents in major areas in india and second phase or stage is the high no of death in areas now design model to find to allocate teams to save maximum lives in India. we use old data to make a predictive model for future preparation with the help of R and python software.\r\n', 'My area of interest is statically interference especially data analysis through random experiment.

In doing so, the ABS prevents the wheels from locking and ensures safe braking; the vehicle remains steerable and stable and also reduces the braking distance.\r\nAirbags on the other hand try to reduce impact on the driver on occurrence of an accident. This combined with the seat belts tries to reduce the injury and worst cases fatality on the roads.\r\nTo conclude, we must use the technologies available to the public to make roads safer in India. As the country progresses, and infrastructure supports a greater number of vehicles at higher speeds, these lifesaving technologies become a priority for its citizens', 'Being an enthusiastic learner i wish to further enhance my knowledge and technical skills and contribute my best towards this project and elucify my ideas in making this project a huge success. \r\nwith my level of devotion and sincerity i wish to achieve great results along with the optimum utilisation of the available resources and make best use of the time allotted to me. \r\nI wish to devote majority of my time and extend my best possible efforts.

A major fraction of these accidents turned up in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, but small cities also witnessed quite a large number of accidents during the period. One of the reasons for such a wicked figure of accidents is that India at present is having a car boom. India is witnessing tremendous growth in automobile sector this seems true to a certain extent, when we look at facts such as, in Delhi alone, almost 10,000 new cars hit the road every month. However, the main reason for large number of accidents is due to negligence and lack of sense of responsibility from the drivers\' part.\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at the causes of road accidents in India:\r\n\r\n1. Speeding and overtakingâ€“ A greater speed surely gives a feeling of rush to the driver but at the same time increases the risk of his vehicle collision.\r\n\r\n2. Talking on Phone while driving â€“ When you talk on a phone while driving, your one hand gets engaged in operating the phone whether it\'s dialing a number or listening to the caller. Even more worse is texting on phone while driving, as it not only takes off your hands of the steering wheel but also your eyes off the road. Always avoid using a phone while driving.\r\n\r\n3. Do not drink and driveâ€“ Fire and ice can still go together, but drinking and driving can never be mixed. Alcohol interferes with the very basic elements of driving such as vision, reflex and sense of judgement. So donâ€™t drink and drive.\r\n\r\n4. Riding Without a Helmet â€“ Many youngsters thinks driving without a helmet is a cool and swag thing. But the fact is a biker looks cooler when he is all geared up with safety knee caps, rider\'s jacket and a sturdy helmet. Wearing a helmet is as important for the pillion rider as for the biker. Head is most susceptible to injuries during a fall. Protecting it with a helmet substantially reduces the chances of injury during an accident.\r\n\r\n5. Not Wearing Seat Belt â€“ Putting a seat belt while driving is as important as same as pulling a parachute while sky diving. It has been scientifically proven that during a head collision, a driver wearing a seat belt has a far better chance to survive.\r\n\r\n6. Breaking Traffic Rules â€“ Something as simple as breaking a red light can put the driver and others vulnerable to serious falls and injuries. Ignorance of road signs can prove to be a breakneck too. Do follow traffic rules; it\'s for your own good.\r\n\r\n7. Poor Road Infrastructure â€“ This is a very common cause of accidents in India. Unlike other factors, the driver here has to suffer without a fault of his own. A bad road is stated by signs such as piles of debris, spilled oil, pits and defective highway lamps.\r\nSAFETY CONSCIOUS PLANNING\r\nAmong the countries that have been most successful in reducing the number of crashes, the main factors seem to include:\r\n\r\nA political commitment, across all ministries concerned, to deal with road accidents\r\nA broad strategy, involving education, engineering and enforcement to deal with accidents\r\nA clear vision and numerical targets for reductions in the different categories of accidents\r\nA concrete plan with specific measures for implementation and enforcement\r\nInstitutional co-ordination within and between different levels of government and with private actors\r\nCareful and critical evaluation of measures and their effectiveness', 'i want to present myself for  the challenges given to me . i  will devote my self with full dedication'),

They break traffic rules, do not stop at the red light,do not wear helmet and seat belt,overtake and create trouble for themselves and their families.\r\n3.

Some corrupt officials take bribe and let the matter go easily ( Rafa dafa karna) so people become negligent towards safety.\r\n4. Sometimes at crosings, the lights are not working,police officer is absent,all these factors lead to accidents \r\n5. People keep their comfort over safety and hence avoid wearing helmets or seat belts.\r\n6. Kids below the age of 18 are given independent vehicles and those newbies try to fully enjoy the newly found freedom which sometimes even cost their lives.\r\n7. Drinking and driving, majorly by the truck and bus drivers \r\nNow, thinking of a solution to this,some reforms can be made.\r\n1.What if people keep a check on each other...

So a rule can be passed that if someone sees another person breaking traffic rules, they can submit their vehicle nos. to the police and police can verify with the help of surveillance cameras present and adequate action can be taken.\r\n2. It is the responsibility of both authorities and civilians that traffic rules be followed and safety be maintained. And civilians are more aware of the problems faced in their areas, so volunteers like retired officers and even children during their vacations can collaborate with the traffic police and devote some time in helping the police managing traffic. For this they would be given prior training and proper knowledge of traffic rules, and later on can be rewarded. \r\n3. Also, spreading awareness about traffic rules and road safety is important. Again, volunteers from particular areas can be trained and then they can help the police to guide other citizens about the rules. \r\nAlready, a lot of productive measures have been taken, like surveillance cameras on the roads, police officials visiting schools and colleges to enlighten the new generation, camps being organised to spread awareness and much more. \r\nBut all efforts will go in vain if corruption and negligence prevails, from both sides. \r\nPeople need to be self motivated and careful so that accidents can be avoided.', 'Expectations- I expect to develop as an individual, improve my soft skills, finally deal and do something about the daily life struggles we all rant about and contribute my bit to the society.

According to me, the chief reason for this is the negligence of people towards safety rules and regulations that should be followed. Many a time, people ignore the rules and tend to not follow them unless a traffic police officer is nearby. Not wearing seat belt and helmets, over speeding and texting while driving are some of the practices making roads unsafe not only for the driver but the others on the road as well.  Another factor of importance here is that many drivers are not familiar with road markings, signs and of their own vehicle. Lack of knowledge can be very dangerous on road. \r\nAnother subsidiary reason to the road accidents are the vehicles. Vehicles not maintained properly can get weared out making them less effective. \r\nAlso, the roads during monsoon season, with rain pouring in everyday, become slippery and prone to accidents. Tires of vehicles can easily skid on such wet roads leading to mishaps.\r\n \r\nThe best way to tackle the problem is to analyse properly the various possible solutions and their feasibility. The most appropriate steps to take for the above-mentioned problem can be\r\n1.	AWARNESS\r\n    1.1.	The best way to increase awareness among people is to have a stricter driverâ€™s license theory test and mandatory training of the various aspects of road safety.\r\n2.	ENFORCMENT\r\n    2.1.	Proper enforcement would require stringent laws and higher penalty for more serious offences and suspension of license.\r\n     2.2.	Another way of enforcing laws is that instead of giving penalties on breaking any of the rules, people would be required to contribute a certain amount of hours to social work depending on the severity of the infringement. The social work could be ranging from working for the deprived or helping regulate traffic in your area. The thought behind this is that most of the people break traffic rules, like jumping a red light or over speeding because they are in a rush but when people realize that because of their actions, they have to spend time on this work, they would stop doing such deeds. Keeping the notion of time is money in mind, this model can be a success in reducing the number of traffic offenders.\r\n    2.3.	The involvement of people of a particular neighborhood in regulating the traffic of that area. The senior citizens and retired people or people from the RWA of a place can be assigned to keep a watch in their neighborhood areas and can report to the traffic police in case of violation of rules. The people can be present especially during rush hours like morning and afternoon school timings to ensure the safety of the students. As people from a neighborhood are familiar with the problems in their areas, this can help in reducing the problems of every region with ease.\r\n', 'The internship offers a great opportunity to work for the betterment of the community and to make it safer for all.  I wish to make a small difference in the society by helping out and doing my part. I have ideas and would like to see them being put to use. Getting a platform to voice my concerns and solutions to the authorities would be a step towards this objective. I dream of making the community and neighborhood safer for the people, pedestrians and drivers alike.\r\nI can devote 15-20 hours per week to the internship for the months of June and July. '),

Automobiles as we see it today was unfolding its prospects for the future whose sole beneficiaries i.e. us were so engaged in celebrating that we failed to infer a complimentary small red beep blinking as a sign of danger in the face of it that engorged the community later with its disguise whom we all know today as Road Accidents.\r\nIndian is a very happening nation where something or the other never ceases to exist to uncover by the media, However Indian Newspapers have a specific constant for their coverage which is Road Accidents and their fatalities that we can distinguish on a daily basis. India suffers in the vicinity of 15 casualties every hour due to road accidents which in itself is not less than an epidemic disease in any sense. Out of the many reasons which causes an outbreak of such ungodly event some of the most dominant of them are as follows,\r\nâ€¢	Drunk Driving\r\nâ€¢	Over Speeding\r\nâ€¢	Failure to comply with Traffic Rules\r\nâ€¢	Distracted Driving\r\nâ€¢	Drowsy Driving\r\nâ€¢	Street Racing\r\nAmidst the above major circumstances, the other causes of accidents are as follows\r\nâ€¢	Potholes \r\nâ€¢	Sharp Turns\r\nâ€¢	Tailgating\r\nâ€¢	Fog \r\nâ€¢	Rain\r\nVehicles and Road accidents are complementary to one other as fire and smoke but in all possibilities, there exists a silver lining that may aid to reduce and decrease these events on an exponential scale. Hopefulness and Innovativeness can create wonders when they go hand in hand and thatâ€™s explicitly is the need of the hour. \r\nWe need Robust Traffic Policies that would further facilitate and help in curbing road accidents apart from this, proper awareness to the circumstances that catalyzes and leads to road accidents must be abundantly made clear, tangible and readily accessible to the people. Realization of Traffic rules and regulation and Awareness and Acknowledgment of Road safety measurements can promote in vast extent the degree of defense against Road accidents. \r\nThis can be brought about by educating through seminars, guest lectures and workshops of the same in each Government and Private offices in the country so that the people get the gist of attributes they need to indulge themselves in so as to prevent Road Accidents. Besides this, the government also needs to incorporate imparting knowledge of the same through Subjects and Practicalâ€™s revolving around Road Safety in the course curriculum of the students so that the youth gets aware of the measures he/she should encounter to prohibit these events with them. Hence the above measures and Program could help in tackling the situation and thereby drastically reduce the Road Accidents in future.\r\n', 'Charity Begins at Home, an expression I sternly designate to abide with. Hence in order to establish a positive disruption and divergence in the field that has been plagued by such occurrences which are unquestionably the issues that can be reduced to a bare minimum with proper care, caution and supervision one needs to investigate his/her conscious so as to unearth the irregularities and loopholes in the system. Therefore, the first initiative in creating a change in the society and diminishing these unwilling happenings would be by bringing about a change in oneself. This change would be brought about by acquiring knowledge and comprehending and also by being updated about the Traffic rules and regulations along with Road Safety measurements and through this Internship I decisively intend to learn and perceive the critical issues and factors regarding the same that come into picture while Road Accidents of any scale takes place amongst us.\r\nThere are numerous challenges and barriers in an attempt to restrain these scenarios but the milestone has to be achieved discretely by approaching the issues in small packages rather than countering them in a bundled lot which would indirectly help in mitigating the situation with a gradual effect. Hence through this internship, I certainly would try to indulge in innovative techniques and proficiency whose future applications would result in containing these instances for the long run. The other important aspect of the internship which I intend to explore is to check the viability and feasibility of the above idea not just in a confined region but to the nation in general. The most critical achievement that I wish to engineer and demonstrate would be reaching and extending the studies, findings and wisdom gained out of this internship to the masses through every platform possible be it print or social media. The impact of this internship would indulge people in exploring the potential of the rules and regulations concerning road safety and optimistically speaking one day the road accidents in India would just exist as a myth and would become completely extinct from taking place.\r\nThe internship requires considerable amount of critical thinking and brainstorming so as the accumulation, generation and germination of an innovative outcome would start to take birth and hence for the same I would certainly make sure to devote and occupy myself for around 4 to 5 hours on a daily basis excluding the field work required so as to gain some fruitful incentives following its inception.\r\n'),

The bad implementation of road renovation and recreation is created low-quality roads, and contractors get away with it by making money through sketchy ways and improper check of roads by the responsible authorities doesn\'t ensure the upgradation of the roads.  Even while applying for the Driving licence, the RTO conducts exams just once for the applicants, which makes it seem like a High School exam. This impacts negatively as after obtaining a licence, drivers don\'t remember much of the rules to be followed, and except the ABCs of the driving. Lack of good quality Helmets and ABS being made optional in cars, road accidents prevail in India.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Road accidents can be solved systematically from various angles. A proper & regular check of road quality should be done and reports should be audited in a fair way. Citizens should be made compulsory to give driving exams at certain intervals post obtaining the Driving license.  low-quality helmets should be banned from markets and helmets should pass through quality control checks. Accidents sensor should be attached to every helmet so that when accidents happen, the nearest hospital can come to the site to rescue. ABS should be made compulsory in all 3 and 4+ wheel vehicles.', 'I expect an insight into policy making from this internship, and drafting a policy for Roads and its measure with the recent announcement of Bharatmala Project My goal would be to get better in the field of Public Policy, as I\'m interested in pursuing my further studies in the same area.

A highway should NEVER go through a TOWN\r\nThis is the reason we make a bypass, so the highway avoids the town.\r\n2.)

Education of the traffic law and rules is also seems to be lacking in the majority of the commuting population. Hence there is so Dharma as far as the traffic norms are concerned. They lack legitimacy. Poor infrastructure aggravates the traffic issues further which lead to jams and disobeying the rules which again lead to road accidents.\r\nThe laws have not been internalised by the citizens and are at times considered alien imposition, a nuisance, a mere money extortion tactic.\r\n\r\nTo tackle all this would first require changing the orientation of our traffic rules. They should move away from just being punitive in nature that too in the form of fines. There\'s a need of actual awareness campaigns for traffic rules and tightening the procedure of granting driving licences.\r\nThere\'s rampant corruption through middle men because of which the learners do not get necessary awareness of traffic norms.\r\n\r\nEnsure community participation in traffic regulation and policy making by getting their regular inputs through local meetings.\r\nSome sort of deliberation is required to move away from this state of nature on roads to a proper controlled traffic movement and the reduction of road accidents.

According to the Road Accident Report for 2014 prepared by the road transport and highways ministry, 75,000 people have been killed because of the killer roads of India.\r\n2)Speeding:Â Another major factor contributing to the increased number of road accidents is speeding. The public fails to follow the speed limits, especially on the highway. This has resulted in 41% of the total deaths due to road accidents in India in 2014.\r\n3)Drunken driving:Â Even though driving under the influence of alcohol is strictly prohibited, many flaunt this rule, which at times results in road accidents. Even if the person under the influence of alcohol walks away safe from the scene of the accident due to the safety features of the car, the pedestrians and smaller vehicles involved in the accidents are not so lucky.\r\n4)Helmets:Â Two-wheelers account for 30% of the road accidents in India. Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of severe injury by 72% and the risk of death by 39%, according to the World Health Organisation. But only a handful of the cities in India have made the use of helmets mandatory.', 'I want to learn about the solution which we apply after identify the causes of accident in India.

Most of the traffic rules are very easy and convenient and contributes most in the safety like wearing helmet , using seat belt while driving , following sign board speed limit , driving in proper lane . But people generally ignore to follow thses rules as they are quite over confident on their driving skills and cost them to get injure and even lose their life . The age group which is more prone to road accidents  belong from 18 - 45 year old . Most of them are educated and aware of rules but still because of their carelessness they do not comply traffic rules . \r\nRash driving and overspending  is major threat now days . Also over weight of public transport or tractors , trucks are very risky . All these conditions evokes disbalance and causes accident . \r\nNow days another problem which is appearing that drivers are using mobile phone  while driving . People are tacking selfee while driving all these activities distracts driver\'s attention and causes accident . \r\n*Solution\r\nSo solution to the accidents related to non compliance with rules require special attention from government as well traffic police department . Laws should be stringent to ensure proper implementation of traffic rules . Traffic police should be inspecting at every major  roads . Heavy penalties should be charged from law breaker and also future warning must be given . Proper facilities must be provided to the traffic police so that they can perform their work with full comfort with excellence . Their salary must be hike so that they don\'t need to bribe . They should be trained and  govt must steps action against bribery.  \r\nStrict action must need to taken in case of over goods because  on highways thses cases are very common . \r\nNow it is the duty of government to start awareness campaign in media to make citizens aware and must form strict policy against law breaker . These policy must that all citizens equally no one will enjoy privileges . Traffic police department must implement government policies strictly and most importantly people should follow traffic rules because disobeying them can cost to an innocent lifes one road.  \r\nAlso youth should come forward to fight against it by campaign and movements . \r\n# Drink and drive \r\nIn most of the accidents it found that driver had consumed alcohol . Drink and drive is most serious issues now days when it comes to causes of road accidents . \r\n\r\n*Solution \r\nI believe that the solution to this problem is same as above strict action should be taken along with active participation of traffic police . More public awareness message should be spread . Also wine shops on highways and main road should be banned in those areas where drink and drive accidents are common . \r\n\r\n# Increase in traffic \r\nIncrease in number of vehicles also continue towards road accidents as because of increase in traffic people don\'t follow traffic rules , try to overtake each other also make it very difficult for pedestal to cross roads . \r\n\r\n* Solution \r\nSolution to this problem is preparing special lane for commercial vehicles , making bicycle track and pedestal track . Also public transport should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n# Inadequate infrastructure \r\nIn our country poor infrastructure also contributes to road accidents . Specially during rainy season pothole create a lot of inconvenience for drivers and causes accident . Poor drainage facility  and raids infrastructure are reason for concern . \r\n\r\n* Solution \r\nGovernment authority must maintain road infrastructure specially during rainy reason .  Roads must be maintained .\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'As I am economics student so this internship will help me in implementation of what I have studied in books that how to conduct survey , how to plan  policy and implement them .

Strict implementation of the traffic rules. The defaulters should be fined heavily for breaking the rules. There should be an  strict enforcement of the use of seat belts in car and helmets on two wheelers.Proper and authorized driver training institutes with adequate infrastructure. Make licensing and driving  only through tests .\r\n\r\n Enforcing the heavy vehicles to fix reflective tapes over them to be clearly visible during night time.Mandatory registration of criminal cases if the vehicle is overloaded.Imprisonment and heavy penalty on  drink and  drive .

Flyovers, grade separators, service roads, sign boards, monitored crossings near schools and other safety features have to be the primary focus while designing new road infrastructure.Need to provide well maintained, safe and efficient public transport systems.Road Safety Awareness in India is very poor therefore there is a need to educate and make people aware of the road safety through various events and programs such as melas, exhibitions, seminars, cultural programs, mobile exhibitions through vans, education through announcements from PA system, following road safety weeks, providing on the spot help and first aid to road users, distribution of road safety literature etc. on a regular basis. This can be done with the help of schools, colleges,  NGOs, transport and trade unions.There is also a need to follow and organizeÂ Road Safety Programs in IndiaÂ on a regular basis through road safety march, street plays, painting, essay and quiz competitions and through regular programs for school kids, pedestrians, drivers of commercial vehicles, auto drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, two wheeler drivers, cyclists etc.\r\n\r\nThere is a dire need for road safety management in our country.

Delhi, being one of the populous metropolitan city, there are innumerable roads that have small patches/ pits that might lead to an accident. While there are traffic lights being installed, the maintenance of theirs is an issue. Many of them sometimes work ill-functionally or out of order which adds to the problem. Improper maintenance of footpaths adds to the problem. Absence of traffic police at majority of the areas, indeed, adds further. I am sorry to say this but it\'s not very difficult to get a fake/ early driving  license and get on the roads. While these loopholes can exist in any of the systems that include such a large population, I appreciate the government taking such initiatives. I, with the help of government, would like to develop a solution to work on these loopholes. It might focus on traffic regulations and proper implementation of the road safety rules. Each area could be assigned with a concerned post and the promotion/ incentives to the person might depend on the number of road issues/ complaints in that area. While this will help us for safer roads, it might also help to deal with the problem of corruption that might be existing.', 'Being a concerned citizen, I am very well aware that the government can\'t do everything for us. It will take our involvement too to tackle the general public problems. While this internship will help me in nourishing my skills and help me learn how to deal with problems on such a big scale, I expect that it will provide me and the others, the general public, a platform to directly communicate the problems and hence the possible solutions for road issues to the government. I may devote a couple of hours daily to achieve the goal of safer roads. '),

It is a natural psyche of humans to excel. If given a chance man  is sure to achieve infinity in speed. But when we are sharing the road  with other  users we will always remain  behind  some or other  vehicle. Increase in speed multiplies the risk of accident and severity of injury during accident. Faster vehicles are more prone  to accident than  the slower one and the severity of accident will also be more  in case of faster. Higher the speed, greater the risk. At high speed the vehicle needs greater distance to stop i.e. braking  distance. A slower vehicle  comes to halt  immediately while faster one takes long way to stop and also skids a long distance due to law of notion.  A vehicle moving on high speed will have  greater impact during the crash and  hence will cause more  injuries. The ability to judge  the  forthcoming events also gets reduced while driving at faster speed which causes error in judgment and finally a crash.\r\n\r\nMy idea  to  curb  the  cases of  over  speeding is to  install an  automated voice  system in vehicles which  would  advise the  driver to  slow down  the  speed when  found  crossing the speed limit. There  would be no provision to mute  this system and  it would constantly warn the driver about the consequences of over speeding until he doesnâ€™t slow down. This system can  also play the voice of the family members of the driver which may have  greater impact on his soul.\r\n', 'I would like to be associated with the IIT Delhi internship program on road safety campaign.

I would also learn to devise an optimal solution for a given problem unlike the haphazard solution which I generally tend to give as a college student due to the lack of exposure. Learning the methodological approach by working alongside the domain experts would help me a great deal in developing projects during my academic course.
